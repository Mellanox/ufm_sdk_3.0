# Adding Plugins to CI Pipeline

This project supports integration of custom plugins into the Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline. The process for integrating your plugin is simple and described below.

## Prerequisites

Your plugin should have a dedicated `.ci` directory that contains a `ci_matrix.yaml` file. This file is used by the CI pipeline to manage the build process for your plugin.

You can use the `ci_matrix.yaml` file found in the `hello_world_plugin` directory as a template.
https://github.com/Mellanox/ufm_sdk_3.0/blob/main/plugins/hello_world_plugin/.ci/ci_matrix.yaml


## CI Configuration Steps

To add your plugin to the CI pipeline, follow these steps:

1. Create a `.ci` directory in your plugin's root directory.

2. In the `.ci` directory, create a `ci_matrix.yaml` file. Use the `ci_matrix.yaml` file in the `hello_world_plugin` directory as a template.

3. The CI pipeline will detect changes in your plugin directory and trigger the CI process. It uses the `ci_matrix.yaml` file in your plugin's `.ci` directory to manage the CI process.

## Important Note

If your plugin directory does not contain a `.ci` directory, the CI process will fail.

## CI Trigger

The CI pipeline gets triggered based on changes made to the plugins. If changes occur in multiple plugins, the pipeline will not trigger the individual `.ci` directories but instead trigger a default empty CI.
