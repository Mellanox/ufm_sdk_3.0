    """
       Prepares an HTTP telemetry filter string based on a list of port type names.

       This function takes a list of port type names as input and constructs a filter string
       that can be used in HTTP telemetry requests. Each port type name is mapped to a corresponding
       integer value using the `PORT_TYPE_NAME_MAP` dictionary, which associates string names with
       `PortType` enum members. The resulting filter string is composed by appending the integer values
       to the base filter string 'port_type__in'. If an unsupported port type name is encountered,
       a warning message is logged, and the port type is skipped.

       Parameters:
           port_types (List[str]): A list of strings representing port type names.

       Returns:
           str: A filter string for HTTP telemetry requests that includes the integer values of
                supported port types.
